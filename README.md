## Overview

As a data analyst as Pewlwtt-Hackard company, my colleague and I were tasked to create a table that contains the number of employees for each title who are getting ready to retire in near future. Since there is a huge nuymber of emplyees getting ready to retire, to help the company prevent the effects of this "silver tsunami" there us a program being introduced that keeo some of the retirees as a part time mentors in the company, so that they can help with training and mentoring the new hires. We were also tasked with identifying the employees who are eligible for this program.
