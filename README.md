# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Overview

As a data analyst as Pewlett-Hackard company, my colleague and I were tasked to create a table that contains the number of employees for each title who are getting ready to retire in near future. Since there is a huge nuymber of emplyees getting ready to retire, to help the company prevent the effects of this "silver tsunami" there us a program being introduced that keeo some of the retirees as a part time mentors in the company, so that they can help with training and mentoring the new hires. We were also tasked with identifying the employees who are eligible for this program. 

The analysis should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Deliverable 3 Requirements
## Results

The results of the two analysis that we performed for this part of the project are as follow:

- There are 74,458 total number of employees who are ready and eligible to retire during the "silver tsunami". 

- The largest portion (35.7%) of the retirees will be from the senior engineers followed by senio staff (34.4%). This will result in a large decrease among senior employees and the mentorship program can help widely to prevent the effects of losing senior team members who are experienced.

- The total number of future retirees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program are 1549 which is only %2.1 of the retirees.
